# Archie
## Why Archie?
Common programming methods for Unity are bug prone. So I decided to build a *system* that powers from a **State Machine & Event Driven Programming**.
## What is Archie Demo?
In my demo you'll find 3 buttons : 
* **Idle** : Stops. *Everything* stops.
* **Game** : *Cube* starts to spinning fast.
* **Exit** : *Cube* waits a second then starts to spinning slowly.
## Where to find Archie Demo?
Soon it will be in Google Play Store.
